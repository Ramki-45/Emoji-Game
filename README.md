🎮 Emoji Memory Game – How to Play

Welcome to the Emoji Memory Game! 🥳 Here’s how it works:

Your Goal:
Click on each emoji only once. Try to remember which ones you’ve already clicked!

Scoring:

Each time you click a new emoji that you haven’t clicked before, your Score increases by 1.

If you click all emojis without repeating, you win the game! 🎉

If you click an emoji you’ve already clicked, you lose the game 😢.

Top Score:

Your Top Score is the highest score you’ve achieved so far.

Even if you lose a game, your Top Score remains until you beat it.

Play Again:

After winning or losing, click “Play Again” to start a new game.

Your current Score will reset to 0, but your Top Score will stay!

Tips:

Take your time and remember the emojis you click.

The more you play, the better your memory gets! 🧠✨

Enjoy the game and challenge yourself! 😎
